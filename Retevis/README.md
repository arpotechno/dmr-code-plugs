## About the files in this directory

The .rdt file is the normal codeplug which your radio programming software
should be able to read.

The .conf file is a human readable version of the same code plug, which
[dmrconfig](https://github.com/sergev/dmrconfig) is also able to write back
to the radio. The .conf files are distributed here with permission from
Serge Vakulenko KK6ABQ.

## RT3_NOCALL_1234

The FinDMR zone in meant for finding quickly if there is a nearby repeater
somewhere. All Finnish 70 cm digital voice & data repeater channels with 12,5
kHz step are included. The TX talkgroups are 244 and 9, but the contact lists
hear a lot more. Consider this, when using that zone for calling or replying
a call.

Zones two to eight, from Espoo to Kouvola are however programmed so that each
channel has only one talkgroup.

 - Finland (244)
 - Lapland (2449)
 - Local (9)
 - QSY 1 (24401)
 - QSY 2 (24402)
 - Worldwide (91)
 - Europe (92)
 - German (910)
 - English (913)
 - Italy (222)
 - Sweden (240)
 - Germany (262)
 - Nordic (927)
 - UK (235)
 - Estonia (248)
 - Parrot (244997)

Unlike with the FinDMR zone, with those zones if you hear something,
you'll transmit to the same talkgroup.

The ninth Analog zone has five simplex channels and 11 repeaters programmed
into it.
